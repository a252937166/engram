LLM agents wake up with amnesia every session. ENGRAM gives a Qwen agent a
**persistent, self-organizing long-term memory** modeled on how biological
memory actually works — and renders the whole thing live as an interactive
"memory constellation," so every recall, reinforcement, contradiction and
consolidation is visible and explainable.

Tell it once that you're vegetarian with a peanut allergy. Days later, in a
brand-new session, ask for a dinner idea — it quietly serves you something
safe. Tell it you changed jobs — the old belief is *superseded*, not
duplicated. Press **Sleep Cycle** — scattered episodic fragments consolidate
into dense semantic knowledge, and stale traces are forgotten.

## Why this is not "just RAG"

| Naive approach | ENGRAM |
|---|---|
| Append full chat history to context | **~800-token memory budget**, greedy-packed from scored memories |
| Similarity-only retrieval | Hybrid score: `0.55·semantic + 0.18·recency + 0.17·importance + 0.10·usage`, with per-type half-lives and a rescue floor for safety-critical memories (allergies surface even at low similarity) |
| Contradictions pile up | **LLM arbitration**: embeddings shortlist neighbors, `qwen3.6-flash` rules *duplicate / replaces / distinct* — changed jobs supersede, a diet and an allergy coexist |
| Store grows forever | **Sleep cycle**: union-find clustering (cos ≥ .80) merges fragments into semantic summaries; retention `0.5·importance + 0.3·usage + 0.2·recency` below floor ⇒ forgotten |
| Memory is a black box | Every recall streams its **score components** to the UI; every memory keeps an audit trail (`superseded_by`, `consolidated_into`, access counts) |

### Memory lifecycle

```
user turn ─▶ EXTRACT (qwen3.6-flash, typed JSON)
                │  preference / semantic / procedural / episodic + importance
                ▼
             EMBED (text-embedding-v4, 256-d)
                │  cos ≥ .90 ──▶ reinforce existing trace (strength +1)
                │  cos ≥ .45 ──▶ ARBITER: duplicate? replaces? distinct?
                ▼                    │ replaces ⇒ old memory superseded
             INSERT (SQLite, WAL)   ◀┘
                ▼
             RECALL on next turn — hybrid score under token budget,
             recalled memories are reinforced (use strengthens the trace)
                ▼
             SLEEP CYCLE — consolidate clusters ⇒ semantic knowledge,
             forget low-retention traces (grace period for young memories)
```

## Built on Qwen Cloud (Alibaba Cloud)

All model calls go through **[`backend/qwen_client.py`](backend/qwen_client.py)**
— this file is the proof of Alibaba Cloud usage — against the Qwen Cloud
Model Studio international endpoint:

```
https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
```

| Model | Role |
|---|---|
| `qwen3.7-plus` | conversational reasoning, SSE streaming, grounded on the injected MEMORY block |
| `qwen3.6-flash` | memory extraction (typed+scored JSON), contradiction arbitration, sleep-cycle summarization |
| `text-embedding-v4` | 256-dim vectors for recall, dedupe and clustering |

The full stack (nginx + systemd + SQLite + backend) is deployed on an
**Alibaba Cloud ECS instance (Beijing)** — live at https://www.hackthon.site / http://47.93.234.51 —
with an HTTPS mirror at https://engram.axiqo.xyz. All model inference
(reasoning, extraction, arbitration, embeddings) runs on Qwen Cloud, so both
the hosting and the AI backbone are Alibaba Cloud.

## Zero-dependency engineering

The production host is a **1-core / 728 MB** CentOS 7 box, so ENGRAM is
**pure Python 3.6 stdlib** — no pip install, no frameworks, no vector DB:

- `backend/server.py` — threaded HTTP + Server-Sent-Events API (~300 lines)
- `backend/engine.py` — the memory engine (~500 lines)
- `backend/qwen_client.py` — Qwen Cloud client with retry/backoff
- `backend/mcp_server.py` — the same engine exposed over MCP
- `frontend/index.html` — single-file UI, no frameworks: canvas force-layout
  constellation, SSE chat, retrieval-score chips, embedded fonts

Guard rails: per-IP rate limiting (nginx + in-process), daily demo quota,
input validation, memory caps per user, systemd `MemoryLimit`, key kept in
`/etc/engram/engram.env` (never in the repo or the client).

## Run it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a252937166/engram && cd engram
export QWEN_API_KEY=sk-...          # from https://home.qwencloud.com/api-keys
python3 backend/server.py           # http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Production deploy (nginx + systemd, one shot):

```bash
QWEN_API_KEY=sk-... bash deploy/deploy.sh your.domain.com
certbot --nginx -d your.domain.com
```

## Mount ENGRAM into any agent (MCP)

The same memory store speaks the Model Context Protocol — Claude Code,
Qwen agents or any MCP client can share the agent's memory:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "engram": {
    "command": "python3", "args": ["backend/mcp_server.py"],
    "env": { "QWEN_API_KEY": "sk-..." } } } }
```

Tools: `engram_remember` · `engram_recall` · `engram_forget` ·
`engram_sleep` · `engram_stats`.

## HTTP API

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/chat` | SSE stream: `retrieval` (scored memories) → `delta`* → `memory_ops` → `done` |
| `GET /api/memories?user_id=` | full memory graph: nodes + similarity links |
| `POST /api/sleep` | run consolidation + forgetting, returns the report |
| `POST /api/forget` | explicit right-to-be-forgotten for one memory |
| `GET /api/bootstrap` · `/api/stats` · `/api/messages` · `POST /api/sessions` | app plumbing |

## Judging map

- **Technical depth** — hybrid scored retrieval with per-type decay,
  LLM-arbitrated belief revision, sleep-cycle consolidation, MCP server,
  streaming pipeline; all on a 728 MB box with zero dependencies.
- **Innovation** — memory as a *first-class visualized citizen*: the
  constellation shows recall beams, reinforcement pulses, supersede flashes
  and consolidation vortexes in real time; every recall is explainable.
- **Value** — cross-session personalization under a fixed token budget
  (context stays ~800 tokens while history grows unbounded); engine is
  embeddable via MCP in any agent stack.
- **Docs** — this README + architecture diagram + one-shot deploy script.
